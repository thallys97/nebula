# Nebula
[![PHP Composer](https://github.com/libra-php/nebula/actions/workflows/php.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/libra-php/nebula/actions/workflows/php.yml)

‚≠ê Nebula is a powerful PHP web framework

‚úÖ Provides developers with a flexible and extensible architecture to build custom web applications with ease.

üë∑ *Currently under development*

‚ùå **Not for production use**


### Getting Started

To get started with Nebula, follow these steps:

- **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using Composer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/libra-php/nebula.git
cd nebula
composer install
```

- **Configuration**: Customize the configuration files according to your project requirements, including database settings and routes.
```
# Copy the example settings
cp .env.example .env
# Change ownership of the view cache
chown -R www-data:www-data views/.cache
```

- **Development**: Start building your application by creating controllers, views, and models within the `src` directory. You can start a local development server by running `./bin/serve`

- **Testing**: Nebula includes a testing suite powered by PHPUnit. Add your tests under the tests directory and run them with: `./bin/test` or `composer run-script test` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`. If you have `siege` installed, then you can benchmark the framework by running `./bin/benchmark`. Make sure you edit the script and change the host name to match your environment.

- **Deployment**: Once your application is ready for deployment, configure your web server to point to the public directory as the document root.

- **Hold up**, there is no documentation! Check back soon!


### Benchmarks

Here are a few sample test results using the `siege` tool. Our team is dedicated to optimizing Nebula to deliver exceptional performance, striving to position it among the top-performing PHP frameworks available üöÄ 

Nebula dev:
```
Lifting the server siege...
Transactions:		      13346 hits
Availability:		     100.00 %
Elapsed time:		       1.92 secs
Data transferred:	       0.17 MB
Response time:		       0.00 secs
Transaction rate:	    6951.04 trans/sec
Throughput:		       0.09 MB/sec
Concurrency:		       9.77
Successful transactions:       13346
Failed transactions:	          0
Longest transaction:	       0.01
Shortest transaction:	       0.00
```

Based on this result, Nebula achieved a transaction rate of 6,951.04 trans/sec. Leaf achieved 7,204.38 trans/sec, and Laravel achieved 632.77 trans/sec.

These numbers demonstrate the strong performance of Nebula and Leaf, making them excellent choices for high-traffic applications. 

While considering these numbers, it's important to approach them with caution. Benchmarking frameworks on my personal network and hardware may not yield an entirely accurate measure of requests per second (RPS). Nonetheless, based on my own tests, this type of benchmarking does reveal a noticeable latency.

- *Command: `siege -b -c 10 -t 1s $APP_URL`*
- *Server is on LAN*
