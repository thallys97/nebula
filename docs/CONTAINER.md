# DI Container


1. Container Refinements: Continue refining and improving your container by adding new features and optimizations. Some potential improvements could include:
Support for named or tagged bindings to allow multiple implementations of an interface to be registered.
Support for aliases, enabling you to define alternate names for bindings.
Resolving circular dependencies to handle cases where classes depend on each other.
Container extension mechanisms, allowing other developers to add their own bindings and configurations.
Service Providers: Implement service providers, a common pattern in dependency injection containers. Service providers encapsulate the configuration and registration of multiple bindings related to a specific feature or module. This helps keep your container organized and makes it easy to add or remove groups of related dependencies.

2. Autowiring Customization: Allow users to customize or override auto-wiring behavior. For example, you might want to let users specify their own concrete implementations for specific interfaces instead of relying solely on auto-wiring.

3. Performance Optimization: Optimize your container for better performance. You could consider caching resolved instances to avoid repeated resolution, optimizing the container's data structures, or employing other performance-improving techniques.

4. Container Extensions and Integration: Consider integrating your container with other parts of the framework, such as the routing system or middleware. This will ensure that the container is utilized throughout the entire framework's architecture.

5. Testing and Validation: Continue testing your container thoroughly with unit tests to ensure it functions correctly in various scenarios. Validate your container's behavior against the PSR-11 Container Interface specification if you plan to adhere to it.

6. Error Handling and Documentation: Improve the error handling in your container, providing clear and informative error messages to aid developers in resolving issues. Also, ensure you document your container extensively to help users understand its capabilities and usage.
