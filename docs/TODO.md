# TODO


- [x]: Dependency Injection Container: Stores and manages the associations between interfaces and their concrete implementations, and it resolves dependencies when requested.

- [ ]: Routing System: Implement a robust routing system that can handle incoming requests and map them to the appropriate controllers and actions. This is a crucial part of any web framework to enable URL-based navigation.

- [ ]: Middleware: Introduce middleware support to handle pre-processing and post-processing tasks for HTTP requests and responses. Middleware allows you to modularize common functionalities like authentication, logging, or caching.

- [ ]: HTTP Abstraction: Create an HTTP abstraction layer to encapsulate HTTP request and response handling. This will make it easier to work with HTTP components and decouple your framework from specific server implementations.

- [ ]: Views and Templating: Develop a templating engine or integrate an existing one to enable separation of logic and presentation. This allows for clean and organized view files for your application.

- [ ]: Error Handling and Logging: Implement a consistent error handling mechanism to gracefully handle exceptions and display appropriate error pages. Additionally, integrate a logging system to track application errors and events.

- [ ]: Configuration Management: Develop a configuration management system that allows users to customize their application settings easily. This could include environment-specific configuration files and other options.

- [ ]: Database Integration: Add support for database access and integration with popular database systems. Consider implementing a database abstraction layer to facilitate multiple database backends.

- [ ]: Validation and Form Handling: Create a library or integration for handling form submissions and data validation. This will be essential for building robust web applications.

- [ ]: Security Measures: Integrate security features, such as CSRF protection, input validation, and output escaping, to safeguard your application against common security vulnerabilities.

- [ ]: Documentation and Testing: As you build new features, ensure to document them properly. Additionally, continue writing unit tests to ensure the stability and reliability of your framework.
