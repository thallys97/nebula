# Kernel Responsibilities 


1. Bootstrapping: The kernel is responsible for bootstrapping the application. This includes initializing essential components, setting up configuration, establishing the container, and performing any required setup tasks.

2. Handling HTTP Requests: The kernel should handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate controllers or middleware. It will receive the request, process it, and return the response to the client.

3. Middleware Execution: The kernel should execute middleware components in the correct order. Middleware intercepts requests and responses and can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or modifying headers.

4. Exception Handling: The kernel should handle exceptions that occur during the request/response lifecycle. It can convert exceptions into appropriate HTTP responses (e.g., error pages) and log errors for debugging.

5. HTTP Abstraction: The kernel should utilize the HTTP abstraction layer to work with HTTP requests and responses in a consistent manner, decoupling the framework from specific server implementations.

6. Application Lifecycle: The kernel manages the application's lifecycle, handling tasks such as application initialization, running the main loop, and shutting down the application gracefully.

7. Dependency Injection: The kernel should leverage the dependency injection container to resolve and inject dependencies into controllers and other framework components.

8. Configuration Management: The kernel might handle loading and managing configuration files and settings for the application.

9. Environment Handling: The kernel may be responsible for managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and applying environment-specific configurations.


Later on, we can then create concrete implementations of this interface, such as WebKernel for web applications and ConsoleKernel for console applications, each tailored to their respective requirements.
